HL byP Scoring System Implementation Summary
===========================================

## What Was Implemented

1. **Added Scoring Parameters**:
   - max_mn_cap = 20 (maximum cap for m+n normalization)
   - enable_hl_byp_scoring = True (toggle for scoring system)
   - on_trend_ratio = 1.5 (trending pivot significance multiplier)

2. **Created Scoring Method**:
   - calculate_hl_byp_score(m, n, pivot_type, is_trending)
   - Normalizes (m+n) to 0-1 range using cap of 20
   - Applies on_trend_ratio multiplier for trending conditions
   - Returns final score between 0-1

3. **Integrated Trade Size Adjustment**:
   - Modified quote_trade() and record_trade() methods
   - Calculates separate scores for highs and lows
   - Uses trending vs normal parameters based on market condition
   - Adjusts trade size: base_entry_size * combined_score

4. **Made Parameters Configurable**:
   - max_mn_cap can be adjusted in main function
   - on_trend_ratio can be uncommented and adjusted

## Scoring Examples
- Normal market (m=10, n=10): score = 0.67 → 67% trade size
- Trending market (m=5, n=5): score = 1.0 → 100% trade size  
- Maximum (m=20, n=20): score varies by condition

## Files Modified
- viphl_strategy.py: Added scoring parameters, method, and trade size integration

Status: Ready for testing

## Latest Update: Enhanced HL byP Scoring with On-Trend Ratio

**Understanding**: 
- Normal m/n: Standard pivot detection (lines 29-32)  
- On-trend m/n: Faster detection during trends (lines 33-36)
- on_trend_ratio: Multiplier showing trending pivots are more significant

**Approach**:
1. Added on_trend_ratio parameter (default 1.5)
2. Updated scoring method to apply ratio for trending conditions
3. Made max_mn_cap configurable in main function
4. Trending pivots now get higher significance scores

**New Scoring Logic**:
- Normal: window_score * by_point_weight
- Trending: window_score * by_point_weight * on_trend_ratio
- Both normalized to 0-1 range

===========================================

## M/N Impact Analysis

**How M/N Affects Score**:
Formula: window_score = (m + n) / (2 * max_mn_cap)

With max_mn_cap = 10:
- Normal (m=10, n=10): window_score = 1.0 → final score ≈ 0.67
- Trending (m=5, n=5): window_score = 0.5 → final score = 1.0

**Current Impact Areas**:
- Trade Size: entry_size = base_entry_size * combined_score
- Pivot Detection Quality: Larger m/n = more reliable but slower

**Does NOT affect**:
- Signal generation thresholds
- Stop loss calculations
- Risk management parameters
- Actual pivot detection logic (handled by PivotHigh/PivotLow classes)

===========================================

## Final Score vs Combined Score Clarification

**Final Score** (calculate_hl_byp_score method):
- Individual score for ONE pivot type (high OR low)
- Range: 0-1 for single pivot configuration
- Formula: window_score * weight_multiplier / max_possible_weight

**Combined Score** (quote_trade/record_trade methods):
- Average of high_score and low_score
- Range: 0-1 (average of two final scores)
- Formula: (high_score + low_score) / 2
- THIS determines actual trade size

Example with max_mn_cap=10:
Normal Market: high=0.67, low=0.53 → combined=0.60 → 60% trade size
Trending Market: high=0.50, low=0.40 → combined=0.45 → 45% trade size

===========================================

## Issue Identified: Configuration Changes Not Affecting Results

**Problem**: User reported that changing configurations doesn't change results at all.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
With current settings (on_trend_ratio=1, max_mn_cap=20):
- Normal conditions: (10+10)/(2*20) * 1 / 1 = 0.5
- Trending conditions: (5+5)/(2*20) * 1 / 1 = 0.25
- Combined score: (0.5 + 0.25) / 2 = 0.375 → 37.5% trade size

**Issue in Scoring Logic**:
The normalization in calculate_hl_byp_score uses max_possible_weight = by_point_weight * on_trend_ratio for both normal and trending conditions. When on_trend_ratio=1, both conditions produce minimal differences.

**Next Steps**: 
- Fix scoring logic to properly differentiate between normal and trending conditions
- Add debug logging to verify scoring calculations
- Ensure parameter changes produce meaningful impact on trade sizes
